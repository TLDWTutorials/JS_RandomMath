# Math Problem Generator

## Description

This project is a simple web application designed to generate random math problems, including both addition and subtraction. It's intended as a basic tool for practice and educational purposes, ensuring that subtraction problems do not result in negative answers.

I made this because I'm too cheap to buy math problem books that cost $10+ and too lazy to write up math problems from scratch. 

## Features

- Generates random math problems (addition and subtraction).
- Allows users to submit answers and receive immediate feedback.
- Users can request new problems as needed.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites are needed for running this application. It can be opened in any modern web browser on any device.
